# Data-Plotting-and-Scikit-Learn

Purpose was to explore matplotlib and explore plotting/graphing lines and scatter plots, as well as utilizing simple regression tools via sklearn library. Exposure to visualizing data and playing around with different forms of visualization with different graph shapes/colors. Learned how to find best fit lines using scipy for simple linear regression, numpy polyfit for n-degree polynomials, and sklearn for multi-var regression.
